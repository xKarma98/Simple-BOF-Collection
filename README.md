## These are my basic BOFS, be aware of the ups and downs of these they aren't evading anything like ETW or EDR's in this default state.
Some I had inspiration off of cobalt strike or Trustedsec, I have left them as .c files so you can review and compile the source code, these have been tested and work on the latest version of windows which is: Win 24H2.

How can you improve these? Look into sleep obfuscation, indirect syscalls, callstack spoofing, string obfuscation, different compilers etc.

#### NOTE:
Lot's of these are aimed at network management api's. Trying to master this before I move to add more stuff.
